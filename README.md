## Overview
I love solving problems and learning with Python. This repo contains code snippets, algorithms, and small projects that I use to sharpen my skills. Each script is well-documented and often comes with test cases to demonstrate functionality.

## Contents
- **Algorithms & Data Structures**: Classic problems, dynamic programming, search and sort algorithms.
- **Python Exercises**: Practice problems from HackerRank, LeetCode, and other platforms.
- **Mini Projects**: Small scripts and projects that explore Python's standard library and popular packages.
- **Learning Experiments**: Code snippets to test ideas, learn new libraries, or practice concepts.
